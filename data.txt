## Project Portfolio

### SmartDocSearch
**Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Amazon Web Services (AWS), PostgreSQL, Large Language Models (LLM), LangChain, LangSmith

**Project Description and Contributions:**

- Designed and successfully deployed an Intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Platform with advanced capabilities for document processing and querying. The system was built to efficiently handle documents stored in AWS S3 buckets, leveraging PostgreSQL's pgvector extension for storing and querying vector embeddings. Implemented robust ethical query validation mechanisms to ensure responsible AI usage and prevent misuse of the system.

- Developed a comprehensive suite of APIs using FastAPI framework, providing a robust interface for client applications to interact with the document search functionality. Complemented this with AWS Lambda functions strategically deployed for specific tasks requiring serverless architecture. This architecture enabled real-time streaming of responses from Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model accessed through AWS Bedrock, providing users with immediate feedback and improving the overall user experience.

- Implemented sophisticated evaluation pipelines using LangSmith to continuously monitor and improve the quality of responses generated by the system. Created specialized agents using LangChain frameworks that enforced ethical guidelines throughout the document handling process, including the screening of both document content and user queries to ensure compliance with established ethical standards and business policies.

### Briefing Note Writer Agent
**Technologies Used:** Python, Flask, OpenAI, PostgreSQL, LangChain, LangGraph

**Project Description and Contributions:**

- Developed an intelligent Briefing Note Writer Agent designed to streamline the complex process of querying and consolidating information from documents distributed across multiple government departments. The agent was capable of transforming disparate sources of information into cohesive, well-structured briefing notes that followed standardized formats and met specific organizational requirements.

- Designed and implemented a robust PostgreSQL database pipeline to efficiently manage extensive document collections. This pipeline provided seamless document management capabilities including efficient insertion of new documents, updating of existing information, and deletion of obsolete or redundant documents. The implementation ensured data integrity and quick retrieval of relevant information when needed.

- Created and deployed specialized intelligent agents using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks to aggregate and synthesize responses from various departmental sources. These agents were designed to ensure comprehensive data retrieval by identifying and addressing information gaps, maintaining consistency in formatting, and adhering to standardized reporting structures required for government documentation.

### AI-Driven OCR and Information Parser
**Technologies Used:** Python, OpenAI, ChromaDB, LangChain, Streamlit

**Project Description and Contributions:**

- Developed a sophisticated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that seamlessly integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies. This system was specifically designed to extract key information from scanned PDF documents in over 20 regional Indian languages, addressing the challenge of linguistic diversity in document processing applications within the Indian context.

- Designed and implemented an advanced language detection methodology that significantly enhanced text extraction accuracy. This methodology was crucial for properly handling documents containing multiple languages or regional dialects, ensuring that the appropriate OCR models and language processing techniques were applied to each document section.

- Optimized text processing workflows to efficiently handle large documents while managing token length constraints imposed by language models. Applied sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to direct the AI's attention to specific document sections and extract targeted information according to precise project requirements and business rules.
